# Stock Market Simulator

An WebApp that simulate playing at stock exchange.
App was made in ReactJS via Vite.
Also I used tailwind instead of regular CSS file.

App is conntecting to Finnhub Stock API for stock price data.

Database I used for storing user login and password is Supabase.

This project took me about 3 months with little brakes.
